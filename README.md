# AICO - AI Assistant Console 

![screenshot](screenshot.png)

AICO is an AI-powered text generation tool using OpenAI's GPT-4 and other supported models.

## Install

Since pre-built binaries are not provided, you will need to install Go to build and run AICO.
Make sure you have _Go version 1.20 or higher_ installed on your system. 
You can check the installed version by running `go version`.

If you do not have Go installed or your version is outdated, download and install it from the [Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).

Once you have Go installed, follow these steps to install AICO:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/micheam/ai-assistant-console.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ai-assistant-console
   ```
3. Use the `go.mod` file to manage dependencies. You don't need to do anything manually since Go will handle this for you.
4. Build the executable binary by running `make`:
   ```bash
   make
   ```
   This will create a binary executable in the `bin/` directory.

Now, you can use commands as described in the [Usage](#usage) section.

## OpenAI API Key

Currently, AICO requires an OpenAI API key to use the GPT-4 API.
You can get an API key from [the OpenAI API Keys page].

Once you have an API key, you can set it in the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your API key>
```

## Usage of the `chat` Command

After building the binary, you can run `chat` to start chatting with AI.

```
